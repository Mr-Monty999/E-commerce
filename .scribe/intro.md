# Introduction


Roles & Permssions System explain :<br>
users have roles, and roles have permissions, and your app always checks for permissions, not roles.

All available permssions:<br>
["create-users","view-users","edit-users","delete-users","create-categories","view-categories","edit-categories","delete-categories","view-permissions","view-roles","create-roles","edit-roles","delete-roles"]
            <br>

            Notes:
            owner it is default role and it bybass all the permissions.
            default user:
            email: owner@owner.com
            password: password
